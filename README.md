Things I want to do

I'm not really sure where I'll end up in life, but these are things I want to do, starting from 01/25/2023. I probably won't keep up with this list, or even GitHub, But I'm going to start it.

I want to become an indie developer and make amazing games, not really for the money, just so me and other people can play cool video games. I'd make games that I'd want to play, wether they be metroidvania, shooter, or whatever; But I'll never make a money-hungry dumpster fire of a game.

My inspirations are Team Cherry, Supergiant, Nintendo, Activision/blizzard (mostly the older games), Mojang, Bethesda, Bungie, and many others.

These are my current dreams as a 13 y/o
